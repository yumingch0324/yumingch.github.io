# Personal Website — Autonomous Driving Engineering & Research

A clean GitHub Pages site for an autonomous‑driving researcher. Uses a teal→blue palette inspired by contemporary mobility design, **not** by or affiliated with any specific company.

## Quick start

1. Create a repository named `<your‑github‑username>.github.io` (for you: `yumingch.github.io`).  
2. Download this folder as a ZIP and extract its contents into the repo.
3. Commit and push. GitHub Pages will serve the site automatically at `https://<username>.github.io/`.
4. Edit `index.html` (name, links, publication list), `assets/Yuming_Chang_CV.pdf`, and section text.
5. (Optional) Replace `assets/og-cover.png` and `assets/favicon.svg` with your own graphics.

## Colors

Defined in `styles.css` as CSS variables:

```css
--brand-green: #00DFA3;
--brand-blue:  #147AFF;
--brand-navy:  #1A2340;
--brand-grey:  #96A0AA;
```

These values are generic **and distinct** from any company’s brand guide. You are free to change them.

## Accessibility

- Large, readable type and high‑contrast gradients.
- Works in light/dark (auto via `prefers-color-scheme`) with a manual toggle.
- Fully responsive and keyboard‑accessible nav.

## License

MIT — you can customize freely. Avoid any third‑party logos or trademarks unless you have permission.
